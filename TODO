+ Some code cleanup.
+ Switch -v now issues the Portfwd version. The debug behavior was replaced
  by -d.
+ The debug switch (now -d) doesn't prevent Portfwd from daemonizing.
+ Forwarders ignore SIGPIPE, maybe fixing the unreproduced, reported,
  random crash bug.
+ Added debug levels. More -d switches, more verbose the logging.
