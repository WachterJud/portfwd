TODO:

- fix reported random crash
  . could not reproduce yet
  . maybe fixed in 0.16 SIGPIPE change?
  . some reports suggest this was fixed in 0.16 (not sure though)
- program reported to choke under load
  . could not reproduce yet
- improve bind-addr config syntax
- non-forking version with support to forwarding port ranges?
- save master-process PID to a file
- support for generic IP forwarding (IPfwd-style)
- close sockets before exiting on SIGTERM
- transparent proxy for linux kernel 2.4.x
- passive ftp support for linux kernel 2.4.x
- Marc Merlin suggestions:
  - Transparent proxy control per ruleset.
  - Issue fatal errors to stderr.
  - Try to bind to local address multiple times (specified by user).
- option to specify range for local source port of
  outgoing sockets; this is useful for services like
  lpd, which expects connections from ports within range 721-731

----
0.24
----

+ Check for failure on creation of tcp outgoing socket.
+ Features added to README.

----
0.23
----

+ Option -g prevents Portfwd from forking into background.
+ Compilation under systems lacking MSG_PROXY.
+ Allow multiple destination addresses for simple round-robin load balancing.
  (See cfg/load-balance.cfg)
  + for TCP
  + for UDP
+ Allow specification of local source address for outgoing connections.
  Note: this overrides the transparent proxying.
  + for TCP
  + for UDP

----
0.22
----

+ Patrik Radman fix for UDP transparent proxy.
+ Applied Patrick Tullmann's patch to compile on FreeBSD-5.0-CURRENT.
+ Applied Marc Merlin's patch.

----
0.21
----

+ Anonymous fixes for compilation under Mandrake 8.0 (gcc 2.96 20000731).

----
0.20
----

+ Zachary Frederick suggestion:
  + On-the-fly name resolution.
+ Marc Merlin suggestion:

+ Alexander Bartolich #include's patch for RedHat 7.0.
+ README, COPYING, CREDITS, TODO added to automake.

----
0.18
----

+ Paul D. Smith patches for non-local builds.
+ FreeBSD port and automake/autoconf support (thanks to Matthew Danish).
+ Solaris port (thanks to Rachel Polanskis).
+ Small fix -- changed incorrect htons(0) to ntohs(0).
+ Minimal man page.

----
0.17
----

+ Transparent proxy support: command line switch: -t
  + for TCP

----
0.16
----

+ Some code cleanup.
+ Switch -v now issues the Portfwd version. The debug behavior was replaced
  by -d.
+ The debug switch (now -d) doesn't prevent Portfwd from daemonizing.
+ Forwarders ignore SIGPIPE, maybe fixing the unreproduced, reported,
  random crash bug.
+ Added debug levels. More -d switches, more verbose the logging.

----
0.15
